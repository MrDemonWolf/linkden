# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is LinkDen?

A self-hosted, open-source link-in-bio platform. Think Linktree, but you own everything and it runs on the edge.

### Is LinkDen free?

Yes. MIT licensed, zero cost. Cloudflare's free tier covers Workers, D1, and Pages -- so hosting is free too.

### Can I use LinkDen commercially?

Absolutely. The MIT license allows unrestricted commercial use. Remove all branding, use it for clients -- no strings attached.

### How is LinkDen different from Linktree?

| Feature | LinkDen | Linktree |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Pricing | Free (self-hosted) | Free tier + paid plans |
| Data ownership | You own everything | Linktree owns your data |
| Custom domain | Full support | Paid plans only |
| Whitelabel | 100% (MIT license) | Not available |
| Analytics | Built-in, private | Built-in, Linktree has access |
| Customization | Full code access | Limited to their editor |
| Apple Wallet | Built-in | Not available |
| Hosting | Your Cloudflare account | Linktree's servers |

## Deployment

### Do I need a Cloudflare account?

For the primary deployment path, yes. LinkDen runs on Cloudflare Workers and Pages. But Docker self-hosting works too if you'd rather skip Cloudflare entirely.

### Can I deploy without Cloudflare?

Yes. See the [Docker](/docs/self-hosting/docker) and [Coolify](/docs/self-hosting/coolify) guides.

### Does LinkDen support multiple users?

LinkDen is a **single-user** platform. One instance = one link page. Need multiple pages? Deploy separate instances.

### How does authentication work?

LinkDen uses Better Auth for email/password login. You create an admin account during the setup wizard at `/admin/setup` -- no external auth service needed. Everything runs on your own server.

## Features

### What block types are available?

Five types: **Link**, **Header**, **Social Icons**, **Embed** (YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, Custom), and **Contact Form**. Each has its own styling, scheduling, and behavior options.

### How many themes are there?

Seven built-in themes, each with dark and light variants (14 total): Default, Corporate Classic, Corporate Modern, Hacker Terminal, Neon Cyber, Furry Pastel, and Furry Bold. You can also customize colors and add custom CSS.

### Can I use my own domain?

Yes. See the [custom domain guide](/docs/self-hosting/custom-domain) for setup instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### The admin panel shows "Failed to..." errors

This usually means the API server isn't reachable.

1. Is the server running? Start everything with `pnpm dev`.
2. Is `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` set correctly? Use `http://localhost:3000` for local dev.
3. Check the server terminal for error output.

### I get CORS errors in the browser

Set `CORS_ORIGIN` to your exact frontend URL. For local dev, that's `http://localhost:3001`.

> **Tip:** No trailing slash, and include the protocol (`http://` or `https://`).

### Database migrations fail

Run `pnpm db:push` from the project root. For a clean slate, reset the D1 database in the Cloudflare dashboard.

### The build fails with type errors

Run `pnpm check-types` to see all errors across the monorepo. Common fixes:

- Add missing environment variables
- Run `pnpm install` to refresh dependencies

### Styles look broken after updating

Clear the Next.js cache and restart:

```bash
rm -rf apps/web/.next
pnpm dev
```

---

## Updating LinkDen

The admin settings page shows a notification when a new version is available. Versions follow semver and are tracked in `version.json` at the project root.

### Update Process

```bash
git pull origin main
pnpm install
pnpm db:generate && pnpm db:push   # if there are schema changes
pnpm deploy
```

### Rolling Back

If something goes wrong, check out a previous commit and redeploy:

```bash
git log --oneline -10
git checkout <commit-hash>
pnpm install
pnpm deploy
```

For database rollbacks, restore from your most recent export. See [Export & Import](/docs/guide/export-import).
