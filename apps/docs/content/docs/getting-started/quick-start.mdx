# Quick Start

You'll go from a fresh install to a live link page in about five minutes. If you haven't installed LinkDen yet, start with the [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) guide.

---

## 1. Run the Setup Wizard

When LinkDen starts for the first time, it prints a one-time setup URL to your **server console**:

```
Setup URL: http://localhost:3001/admin/setup?token=<unique-token>
```

Open that URL in your browser. The token keeps setup secure -- it's only valid once.

> **Tip:** If you go to `/admin/setup` without the token, the page will tell you to check your server console.

The wizard has 4 quick steps:

1. **Account** -- Pick a name, email, and password for your admin login.
2. **Profile** -- Add a bio and avatar (or skip these for now).
3. **Theme** -- Choose from 7 theme presets. Each shows color swatches so you can preview.
4. **Done** -- Hit "Go to Builder" to start adding content.

The setup token is automatically invalidated once you finish.

## 2. Add Your First Blocks

The builder at `/admin/builder` has two panels: your block list on the left, and a live phone preview on the right.

Click **Add Block** to choose from five block types:

- **Link** -- A clickable button that sends visitors to any URL.
- **Header** -- A text heading to organize your page into sections.
- **Social Icons** -- A row of branded social media links.
- **Embed** -- Embed content from YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, and more.
- **Contact Form** -- Let visitors send you a message right from your page.

### Try adding a link

1. Click **Add Block** and select **Link**.
2. Fill in a **Title** (the button text) and a **URL** (the destination).
3. Optionally, switch to the **Style** tab to customize colors, icons, or animation.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

You can drag blocks by their grip handle to reorder them anytime.

---

## 3. Set Up Social Icons

Head to `/admin/social` to manage your social network links.

Search for any platform by name, or browse by category (Social, Video, Music, Development, and more). Toggle networks on or off and paste in your profile URLs. Active networks show up in any **Social Icons** block on your page.

> **Tip:** Dark brand icons automatically adjust for visibility in dark mode -- no extra setup needed.

---

## 4. Configure Settings

Visit `/admin/settings` to fine-tune your instance:

- **Profile** -- Display name, avatar, and bio.
- **SEO** -- Page title, meta description, and OG image.
- **Contact Form** -- Enable or disable, choose delivery mode (database, email, or both).
- **CAPTCHA** -- Add Cloudflare Turnstile or Google reCAPTCHA for form protection.
- **Email** -- Set up Resend or Cloudflare Email Workers for notifications.
- **Export / Import** -- Backup and restore your data as JSON.
- **About** -- Check your current version and look for updates.

For visual customization (themes, banners, verified badge, branding), head to the [Appearance](/docs/guide/appearance) page at `/admin/appearance`.

## 5. View Your Public Page

Click **View Page** in the dashboard header, or just visit your domain root. That's your live link-in-bio page -- share it anywhere.
