# Quick Start

This guide walks you through the first-time setup of a LinkDen instance. If you have not yet installed LinkDen, see the [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) guide first.

---

## 1. Run the Setup Wizard

Navigate to `/admin/setup` on your LinkDen instance (e.g., `http://localhost:3001/admin/setup`).

The setup wizard walks you through 4 steps:

### Step 1: Account

Create your admin account with Better Auth (email/password):

- **Name** -- Your display name (required).
- **Email** -- Your email address for sign-in (required).
- **Password** -- Minimum 8 characters (required).

### Step 2: Profile

Set up your public profile:

- **Bio** -- A short tagline or description (optional).
- **Avatar URL** -- URL to your profile image (optional).

Both fields can be skipped and configured later in settings.

### Step 3: Theme

Choose a theme preset from the 7 available themes. Each theme is shown as a card with two color swatches. Click any theme to select it.

### Step 4: Done

A confirmation screen with a "Go to Builder" button that redirects to `/admin/builder`.

## 2. Add Your First Blocks

The block builder at `/admin/builder` uses a two-panel layout:

- **Left panel** -- Your block list with an "Add Block" dropdown button.
- **Right panel** -- A live phone preview (visible on larger screens).

Click **Add Block** to see the 5 block types:

| Block Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Link** | A clickable button linking to an external URL |
| **Header** | A text heading to group or label sections |
| **Social Icons** | A row of social media icon links |
| **Embed** | Embed YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, or custom content |
| **Contact Form** | A contact form for visitors to message you |

### Adding a Link

1. Click **Add Block** and select **Link**.
2. In the edit panel that slides in, fill in:
   - **Title** -- The text shown on the button (e.g., "My Website").
   - **URL** -- The destination URL.
3. Use the **Style** tab to configure icon, colors, border, and animation.
4. Use the **Schedule** tab to set start/end dates for time-limited visibility.
5. Click **Save Changes**.

### Reordering Blocks

Drag any block in the list using the grip handle to reorder. The order updates immediately via the `blocks.reorder` mutation.

## 3. Manage Social Icons

Navigate to `/admin/social` to toggle which social networks are active. Active networks become available for use in **Social Icons** blocks. Search by name or filter to see only active networks.

---

## 4. Configure Settings

Navigate to `/admin/settings` to configure your instance:

- **Profile** -- Display name, avatar, bio.
- **SEO** -- Page title, meta description, OG image.
- **Contact Form** -- Enable/disable, delivery mode (database only, email notification, or both).
- **CAPTCHA** -- Provider (none, Cloudflare Turnstile, Google reCAPTCHA) with site key and secret key.
- **Email** -- Provider (Resend or Cloudflare Email Workers), API key, from address.
- **Export / Import** -- Backup and restore data as JSON.
- **About** -- Current version and update check.

Visual settings like themes, banner, verified badge, and branding are configured on the [Appearance](/docs/guide/appearance) page at `/admin/appearance`.

## 5. View Your Public Page

Click **View Page** in the dashboard header (or navigate to your domain root) to see your live public link page.

Share this URL as your link-in-bio across social media profiles.
