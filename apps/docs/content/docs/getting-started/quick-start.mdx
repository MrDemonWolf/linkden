# Quick Start

This guide walks you through the first-time setup of a deployed LinkDen instance. If you have not yet deployed, see the [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) guide first.

---

## 1. Access the Admin Panel

Navigate to `/admin` on your LinkDen domain (e.g., `https://yoursite.com/admin`).

You will be prompted to sign in via your configured auth provider:

- **Cloudflare Access** -- Log in through your Cloudflare Access policy (SSO, one-time PIN, etc.).
- **Clerk** -- Log in via the Clerk-hosted sign-in page using email, Google, or another configured provider.

After signing in, you land directly in the 3-panel admin editor.

## 2. Set Up Your Profile

In the **right panel**, click the **Settings** tab. Fill in your profile details:

- **Display Name** -- Your name or brand (shown on the public page).
- **Bio** -- A short tagline or description.
- **Avatar** -- Upload a profile photo (JPEG, PNG, or WebP).
- **Verified Badge** -- Toggle to show a verified checkmark next to your name.

Click **Save** (these changes go to draft -- you will publish everything at the end).

---

## 3. Add Your First Links

In the **left panel**, the **Add Blocks** tab is shown by default.

1. Use the search bar to find a block type or browse the grid.
2. Click **Link** to add a standard link block.
3. In the edit form that appears, fill in:
   - **Title** -- The text shown on the button (e.g., "My Website").
   - **URL** -- The destination URL (e.g., `https://yoursite.com`).
   - **Icon** -- Optional. Search the built-in brand icon set.
4. Click **Save**.

The link appears instantly in the phone preview in the center panel.

Repeat for as many links as you need. You can also add:

- **Heading** blocks to group links visually.
- **Text** blocks for announcements or descriptions.
- **Spacer** blocks for breathing room between sections.

### Reordering Links

Drag any link card directly on the phone preview to reorder. The order updates live.

---

## 4. Choose a Theme

In the **right panel**, click the **Design** tab.

- Browse the theme grid. Click any theme card to apply it instantly -- the preview updates in real time.
- Each theme has dark and light variants. Use the **Mode** selector to choose `dark`, `light`, or `system` (follows the visitor's OS preference).
- Adjust the **Accent Color**, **Background Color**, and **Text Color** if you want to go beyond the theme defaults.

Visitors can also toggle dark/light mode themselves using the button on your public page.

---

## 5. Publish

When you are happy with your setup, click the **Publish** button in the top bar.

Publish saves all draft changes to the live database and automatically purges the edge cache. Your public page updates within seconds.

The Publish button is styled with a gradient glow to make it easy to spot.

---

## 6. View Your Public Page

Click **View Page** in the top bar (or navigate directly to your domain root) to see your live public link page.

Share this URL as your link-in-bio across social media profiles.
