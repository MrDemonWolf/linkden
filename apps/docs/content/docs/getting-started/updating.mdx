# Updating LinkDen

LinkDen follows semantic versioning. The current version is tracked in `version.json` at the root of the repository. The admin dashboard shows a notification when a new version is available.

## Update Process

### 1. Pull the Latest Changes

```bash
git pull origin main
```

If you have local modifications, stash them first:

```bash
git stash
git pull origin main
git stash pop
```

### 2. Install Updated Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

This updates any new or changed dependencies across all workspaces.

### 3. Run Database Migrations

If the update includes database schema changes, generate and push migrations:

```bash
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:push
```

Check the release notes to see if migrations are required. Running `db:push` when there are no changes is safe -- it simply reports that everything is up to date.

### 4. Rebuild and Deploy

```bash
pnpm cf:deploy
```

This rebuilds all apps and deploys the updated versions to Cloudflare.

## Checking for Updates

The admin settings page checks the `version.json` file against the latest release. You can also check manually:

```bash
git fetch origin
git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline
```

This shows any commits on `main` that you have not pulled yet.

## Rolling Back

If an update causes issues, you can roll back to a previous version:

```bash
git log --oneline -10  # Find the commit to roll back to
git checkout <commit-hash>
pnpm install
pnpm cf:deploy
```

For database rollbacks, restore from your most recent export (see [Export/Import](/docs/features/export-import)).

## Best Practices

- **Back up your data** before updating. Use the export feature in the admin settings.
- **Read the release notes** for each version to understand what changed.
- **Test locally** before deploying. Run `pnpm dev` and verify everything works.
- **Keep your fork in sync** if you have customizations. Regularly merge upstream changes.
