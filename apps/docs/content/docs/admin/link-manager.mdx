# Link Manager

The link manager at `/admin/links` is where you create and organize all the content on your public link page. It supports multiple block types and drag-and-drop reordering.

## Link List View

The main view shows all your links and blocks in their current display order. Each item shows:

- **Drag handle** -- Grab and drag to reorder.
- **Icon** -- The selected brand icon (if any).
- **Title** -- The link or block title.
- **Type badge** -- Shows the block type (Link, Heading, Text, Spacer, etc.).
- **Visibility toggle** -- Show or hide the item on the public page.
- **Edit button** -- Open the item editor.

## Creating a New Link

1. Click **Add New** in the top right or navigate to `/admin/links/new`.
2. Select the block type from the type selector.
3. Fill in the required fields for that type.
4. Click **Save**.

### Link Fields

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Type | Block type (Link, Heading, Text, etc.) | Yes |
| Title | Display text on the button | Yes (except Spacer) |
| URL | Destination URL | Yes (Link type only) |
| Icon | Brand icon from the icon picker | No |
| New Tab | Open link in new tab | No (default: yes) |
| Visible | Show on public page | No (default: yes) |

## Editing a Link

Click any item in the list or navigate to `/admin/links/[id]`. The edit form is identical to the creation form with your existing values pre-filled.

Changes are saved immediately when you click **Save**. The public page reflects changes within seconds.

## Reordering Links

The link list supports drag-and-drop reordering:

1. Hover over the drag handle on the left side of any item.
2. Click and hold to pick it up.
3. Drag to the desired position.
4. Release to drop.

The new order is saved automatically. No save button is needed for reordering.

## Visibility Toggle

Each item has a visibility toggle (eye icon). Toggling an item off hides it from the public page but keeps it in your admin list. This is useful for:

- Temporarily removing a link without deleting it.
- Preparing links in advance and making them visible later.
- Seasonal or time-limited content.

## Deleting a Link

1. Open the item editor by clicking on the item.
2. Scroll to the bottom and click **Delete**.
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog.

Deleted items are permanently removed and cannot be recovered. Export your data first if you want a backup.

## Bulk Actions

The link manager supports selecting multiple items for bulk operations:

- **Delete selected** -- Remove multiple items at once.
- **Hide selected** -- Toggle visibility off for multiple items.
- **Show selected** -- Toggle visibility on for multiple items.
