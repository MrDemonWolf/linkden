# Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard at `/admin` is your command center for managing your LinkDen instance. It uses a 3-panel editor layout inspired by SmartBio, giving you a live preview of your public page as you make changes.

## Accessing the Dashboard

1. Navigate to `/admin` on your LinkDen instance.
2. Sign in via Cloudflare Access or Clerk (depending on your configuration).
3. You land on the 3-panel editor.

## Editor Layout

The admin panel uses a 3-column layout on desktop:

### Left Panel (Blocks)

The left panel is a collapsible sidebar. It collapses to an icon-only rail to give the preview more space, and expands to show section labels. Click any icon or the expand toggle to switch modes.

Sections accessible from the left panel:

- **Add Blocks** -- Grid of available block types with labels and short descriptions. Includes a search bar to filter by name. Click a type to add a block instantly. Single-instance block types (vCard, Wallet, Contact Form) are greyed out once already added.
- **Block List** -- Ordered list of all your blocks. Toggle visibility, delete, or click to edit.
- **Social** -- Manage social media icon links that appear as a row on your public page.
- **Drawers** -- Quick-access buttons for Analytics, vCard, Wallet, Contacts, and Pages. These open as slide-in drawers with `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` for accessibility.

The Docs and Settings shortcuts that were previously at the bottom of the left panel have been removed. Access settings via the Right Panel Settings tab and documentation at the docs site directly.

### Center Panel (Live Preview)

A device-frame mockup that renders your actual public page in real time. Changes to blocks, settings, colors, and themes are reflected instantly in the preview.

Device size toggles let you preview at three breakpoints:

| Device | Width | Height |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Phone | 393px | 852px |
| Tablet | 820px | 1180px |
| Desktop | 1440px | 900px |

The preview uses premium CSS device frames with reflective gradients, an ambient glow effect behind the frame, a noise texture overlay, and browser chrome styling on the desktop view.

**Drag-and-drop reordering** works directly on the phone preview. Grab any link block and drag it to a new position. The order updates live. This feature uses `@hello-pangea/dnd` and works on touch devices as well as mouse.

### Right Panel (Design / Analytics / Settings)

Three tabs at the top. Settings groups within each tab are separated by visible section dividers and use consistent `p-5` padding throughout:

- **Design** -- Theme selector with visual previews, color customization (accent, background, text), and branding settings (name, logo).
- **Analytics** -- Quick stats showing total views, clicks, and CTR.
- **Settings** -- Profile info (name, bio, avatar), contact form toggle, CAPTCHA type selector, SEO/meta fields, and export/import.

**Verified badge placement:** The verified badge (checkmark icon) is shown inline next to your display name in the profile section of the right panel and on the public page. It is no longer displayed as an overlay on the avatar image.

### Top Bar

The top bar spans the full width and includes:

- **LinkDen logo** -- Rendered in the Sora font.
- Device size toggles (Phone / Tablet / Desktop)
- Preview and "View Page" links
- **Publish button** -- Gradient style with a subtle glow effect. Saves all draft changes to the live page and purges the edge cache. The button label also uses the Sora font.

## Mobile Layout

On screens narrower than 1024px, the 3-panel layout collapses to a bottom tab bar with three tabs: **Blocks**, **Preview**, and **Design**. Tap a tab to switch between panels.

## Publishing Changes

Click the **Publish** button in the top bar to save all pending changes. The public page updates immediately -- the edge cache is automatically purged so visitors see your changes within seconds.

## Dedicated Pages

Some features have their own full-page views accessible from the left panel:

- **Analytics** (`/admin/analytics`) -- Full analytics dashboard with charts.
- **vCard** (`/admin/vcard`) -- Detailed vCard editor.
- **Wallet** (`/admin/wallet`) -- Apple Wallet pass designer.
- **Contacts** (`/admin/contacts`) -- Contact form submissions.
- **Pages** (`/admin/pages`) -- Custom page management.

Each full page includes a "Back to Editor" link to return to the 3-panel view.
