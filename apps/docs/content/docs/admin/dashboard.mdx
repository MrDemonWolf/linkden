# Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard at `/admin` is your command center for managing your LinkDen instance. It uses a 3-panel editor layout inspired by SmartBio, giving you a live preview of your public page as you make changes.

## Accessing the Dashboard

1. Navigate to `/admin` on your LinkDen instance.
2. Sign in via Cloudflare Access or Clerk (depending on your configuration).
3. You land on the 3-panel editor.

## Editor Layout

The admin panel uses a 3-column layout on desktop:

### Left Panel (Blocks)

The left panel is your content manager with multiple sections accessible via an icon rail:

- **Add Blocks** -- Grid of available block types (link, heading, text, email, phone, vCard, spacer, wallet). Click to add a new block.
- **Block List** -- Drag-and-drop ordered list of all your blocks. Toggle visibility, delete, or reorder.
- **Social** -- Manage social media icon links that appear as a row on your public page.
- **Pages** -- Quick access to custom pages, contacts, vCard, wallet, and analytics.

### Center Panel (Live Preview)

A phone-frame mockup that renders your actual public page in real time. Changes to blocks, settings, colors, and themes are reflected instantly in the preview.

Device size toggles let you preview at phone (375px), tablet (768px), or desktop (1024px) widths.

### Right Panel (Design / Analytics / Settings)

Three tabs at the top:

- **Design** -- Theme selector with visual previews, color customization (accent, background, text), and branding settings (name, logo).
- **Analytics** -- Quick stats showing total views, clicks, and CTR.
- **Settings** -- Profile info (name, bio, avatar, verified badge), contact form toggle, CAPTCHA keys, SEO/meta fields, and export/import.

### Top Bar

The top bar spans the full width and includes:

- LinkDen logo
- Device size toggles
- Preview and "View Page" links
- Publish button (saves all changes to the server)

## Mobile Layout

On screens narrower than 1024px, the 3-panel layout collapses to a bottom tab bar with three tabs: **Blocks**, **Preview**, and **Design**. Tap a tab to switch between panels.

## Publishing Changes

Click the **Publish** button in the top bar to save all pending changes. The public page updates immediately -- the edge cache is automatically purged so visitors see your changes within seconds.

## Dedicated Pages

Some features have their own full-page views accessible from the left panel:

- **Analytics** (`/admin/analytics`) -- Full analytics dashboard with charts.
- **vCard** (`/admin/vcard`) -- Detailed vCard editor.
- **Wallet** (`/admin/wallet`) -- Apple Wallet pass designer.
- **Contacts** (`/admin/contacts`) -- Contact form submissions.
- **Pages** (`/admin/pages`) -- Custom page management.

Each full page includes a "Back to Editor" link to return to the 3-panel view.
