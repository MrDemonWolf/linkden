# Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard at `/admin` is your command center for managing your LinkDen instance. It provides an overview of key metrics and quick access to all admin features.

## Accessing the Dashboard

1. Navigate to `/admin` on your LinkDen instance.
2. Sign in with your Better Auth credentials (email/password) at `/admin/login`.
3. You land on the dashboard.

If this is your first time, you will be redirected to the setup wizard at `/admin/setup` instead.

## Dashboard Layout

### Header

The page header includes two action buttons:

- **Builder** -- Links to `/admin/builder` to manage your blocks.
- **View Page** -- Opens your public page in a new tab.

### Stat Cards

Three stat cards are displayed in a 3-column grid:

| Card | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Total Views** | Eye (blue) | Total page views over the last 7 days |
| **Total Clicks** | MousePointerClick (green) | Total link clicks over the last 7 days |
| **Unread Contacts** | Mail (orange) | Count of unread contact form submissions (links to `/admin/contacts`) |

### Views Chart

A bar chart showing page views over the last 7 days. Each bar displays the view count on hover. Day labels show short weekday names. A "View all" link navigates to the full analytics page at `/admin/analytics`.

### Version Card

Shows the current app version. If an update is available, displays an "Update to X.X.X" button linking to the release page. Otherwise shows "Up to date".

## Navigation
