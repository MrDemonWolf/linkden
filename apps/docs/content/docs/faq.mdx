# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is LinkDen?

LinkDen is a self-hosted, open-source link-in-bio platform. It's a modern alternative to Linktree, built on the Cloudflare stack with a full admin panel and edge performance.

### Is LinkDen free?

Yes. LinkDen is MIT licensed and completely free. Cloudflare's free tier covers Workers, D1, and Pages -- so you can deploy at zero cost.

### Can I use LinkDen commercially?

Absolutely. The MIT license allows unrestricted commercial use. You can remove all LinkDen branding and use it for clients, businesses, or any purpose.

### How is LinkDen different from Linktree?

| Feature | LinkDen | Linktree |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Pricing | Free (self-hosted) | Free tier + paid plans |
| Data ownership | You own everything | Linktree owns your data |
| Custom domain | Full support | Paid plans only |
| Whitelabel | 100% (MIT license) | Not available |
| Analytics | Built-in, private | Built-in, Linktree has access |
| Customization | Full code access | Limited to their editor |

## Deployment

### Do I need a Cloudflare account?

Yes for the primary deployment path. LinkDen runs on Cloudflare Workers (API) and can deploy the frontend to Cloudflare Pages. However, Docker self-hosting is also supported.

### Can I deploy without Cloudflare?

Yes. LinkDen includes a Docker setup for self-hosting outside Cloudflare. See the [Docker](/docs/self-hosting/docker) and [Coolify](/docs/self-hosting/coolify) guides.

### Does LinkDen support multiple users?

LinkDen is designed as a **single-user** platform. One instance = one link page. If you need multiple users, deploy separate instances.

### How does authentication work?

LinkDen uses Better Auth with email/password authentication. During first-time setup, you create an admin account through the setup wizard. No external auth service (Clerk, Auth0, etc.) is needed. See the [authentication guide](/docs/api/authentication).

## Features

### What block types are available?

LinkDen supports 5 block types: **Link**, **Header**, **Social Icons**, **Embed** (YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, Custom), and **Contact Form**. Each block type has its own configuration options for styling, scheduling, and behavior.

### How many themes are there?

7 built-in themes, each with both dark and light variants (14 total): Default, Corporate Classic, Corporate Modern, Hacker Terminal, Neon Cyber, Furry Pastel, and Furry Bold. You can also customize colors and add custom CSS.

### Can I use my own domain?

Yes. See the [custom domain guide](/docs/self-hosting/custom-domain) for DNS configuration instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### The admin panel shows "Failed to..." errors

This usually means the API server isn't running or isn't reachable. Check:

1. Is the server running? Run `pnpm dev` from the project root to start all apps.
2. Is `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` set correctly in `.env`? It should be `http://localhost:3000` for local development.
3. Check the server logs for errors.

### I get CORS errors in the browser

The `CORS_ORIGIN` environment variable must match your frontend URL exactly. For local development, set it to `http://localhost:3001` in `.env`.

### Database migrations fail

Run `pnpm db:push` from the project root. For a fresh start, you can reset the D1 database in the Cloudflare dashboard.

### The build fails with type errors

Run `pnpm check-types` to see all type errors across the monorepo. Common causes:
- Missing environment variables
- Out-of-date dependencies -- run `pnpm install` to refresh

### Styles look broken after updating

Clear the Next.js cache: `rm -rf apps/web/.next` and restart the dev server.
