## Documentation Site

This documentation site is provided for informational purposes. While we strive for accuracy, content may be outdated or contain errors.

## Self-Hosted Instances

When you self-host LinkDen:

- **You are responsible** for your instance, its content, and compliance with applicable laws.
- **You are responsible** for your own terms of service, privacy policy, and data handling.
- **You are responsible** for securing your deployment and protecting user data.
- LinkDen is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.

## Whitelabel Usage

LinkDen's whitelabel feature lets you remove all LinkDen branding. No attribution is required -- use any brand name, logo, or styling you like. Just don't claim to have built the underlying software if someone asks.
