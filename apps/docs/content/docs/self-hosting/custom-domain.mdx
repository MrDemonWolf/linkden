# Custom Domain Setup

After deploying LinkDen, you can add a custom domain so your link page is accessible at `yourdomain.com` instead of the default `*.pages.dev` URL.

## Option 1: Domain on Cloudflare DNS

If your domain is already using Cloudflare's nameservers, the setup is automatic:

### 1. Add the Custom Domain

1. Go to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
2. Navigate to **Workers & Pages**.
3. Click on your LinkDen Pages project.
4. Go to **Custom Domains**.
5. Click **Set up a custom domain**.
6. Enter your domain (e.g., `links.yourdomain.com` or `yourdomain.com`).
7. Click **Activate domain**.

Cloudflare automatically creates the necessary DNS records. The domain is active within minutes.

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in `apps/web/.env` to your new domain:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

Redeploy for the change to take effect:

```bash
pnpm cf:deploy
```

## Option 2: Domain on External DNS

If your domain uses a different DNS provider (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy, Route 53):

### 1. Add the Custom Domain in Cloudflare

Follow the same steps as Option 1 to add the domain in the Cloudflare dashboard. Cloudflare will show you a CNAME record to add.

### 2. Add the DNS Record

At your DNS provider, add a CNAME record:

| Type | Name | Target |
|------|------|--------|
| CNAME | `@` or subdomain | `your-project.pages.dev` |

Replace `your-project.pages.dev` with the actual Pages URL shown in the Cloudflare dashboard.

### 3. Wait for Propagation

DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate, though most providers update within 30 minutes. Cloudflare will show the domain as "Active" once the CNAME is verified.

### 4. SSL Certificate

Cloudflare automatically provisions an SSL certificate for your custom domain. No manual certificate management is needed.

## Using an Apex Domain

To use an apex domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com` without a subdomain):

- **Cloudflare DNS**: Works automatically. Cloudflare uses CNAME flattening.
- **External DNS**: Some providers do not support CNAME records on the apex. In this case, either:
  - Transfer your domain to Cloudflare (free).
  - Use a subdomain instead (e.g., `links.yourdomain.com`).
  - Check if your provider supports ALIAS or ANAME records as alternatives.

## API Domain

The Hono API Worker gets its own URL (e.g., `linkden-api.your-subdomain.workers.dev`). You can add a custom domain for the Worker too:

1. Go to **Workers & Pages** in the Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Click on your API Worker.
3. Go to **Triggers > Custom Domains**.
4. Add your API domain (e.g., `api.yourdomain.com`).

Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `apps/web/.env` to match:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
```

## Verifying the Setup

After configuring your custom domain:

1. Visit your domain in a browser -- you should see the public link page.
2. Check that the SSL lock icon appears (HTTPS is active).
3. Navigate to `/admin` and verify the sign-in flow works.
4. Test that API calls work by viewing analytics or editing a link.
