# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 2026

LinkDen is an open-source, self-hosted application. This policy covers the **documentation site** at `mrdemonwolf.github.io/linkden`. If you self-host LinkDen, your own privacy policy applies to your instance.

## What We Collect

### Documentation Site

This is a static site hosted on **GitHub Pages**. We do not:

- Use cookies or tracking scripts
- Collect personal information
- Use analytics services
- Store any visitor data

GitHub Pages may collect basic server logs (IP addresses, user-agent strings) as part of standard hosting. See [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) for details.

### Self-Hosted Instances

When you deploy your own LinkDen instance, **you** are the data controller. LinkDen stores the following in your Cloudflare D1 database:

- **Profile data** -- name, bio, profile image URL
- **Links** -- URLs, titles, icons, sort order
- **Settings** -- theme, colors, branding, configuration
- **Analytics** -- page views, link clicks, referrers, country codes (from Cloudflare headers)
- **Contact form submissions** -- name, email, message (if enabled)
- **vCard data** -- contact information you configure

All data lives in **your own** database. LinkDen does not phone home, send telemetry, or share data with third parties.

## Third-Party Services

Self-hosted instances may optionally integrate with:

- **Cloudflare** -- hosting and CDN (see [Cloudflare's Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/))
- **Resend** -- email delivery for contact form notifications (see [Resend's Privacy Policy](https://resend.com/legal/privacy-policy))

> **Tip:** Authentication is handled by Better Auth, which runs entirely on your server -- no data is sent to external auth providers.

## Your Rights

Since LinkDen is self-hosted, you have complete control over all data. Export, delete, or modify anything at any time through the admin panel or directly in your D1 database.

## Contact

For questions about this policy, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mrdemonwolf/linkden/issues).
