# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 2026

LinkDen is an open-source, self-hosted application. This privacy policy covers the **documentation site** hosted at `mrdemonwolf.github.io/linkden`. If you self-host LinkDen, your own privacy policy applies to your instance.

## What We Collect

### Documentation Site

This documentation site is a static site hosted on **GitHub Pages**. We do not:

- Use cookies or tracking scripts
- Collect personal information
- Use analytics services
- Store any visitor data

GitHub Pages may collect basic server logs (IP addresses, user-agent strings) as part of their standard hosting. See [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) for details.

### Self-Hosted Instances

When you deploy your own LinkDen instance, **you** are the data controller. LinkDen stores the following data in your Cloudflare D1 database:

- **Profile data** — name, bio, profile image URL
- **Links** — URLs, titles, icons, sort order
- **Settings** — theme, colors, branding, configuration
- **Analytics** — page views, link clicks, referrers, country codes (from Cloudflare headers)
- **Contact form submissions** — name, email, message (if contact form is enabled)
- **vCard data** — contact information you configure

All data is stored in **your own** Cloudflare D1 database. LinkDen does not phone home, send telemetry, or share data with third parties.

## Third-Party Services

Self-hosted LinkDen instances may optionally integrate with:

- **Clerk** — authentication provider (see [Clerk's Privacy Policy](https://clerk.com/legal/privacy))
- **Cloudflare** — hosting and CDN (see [Cloudflare's Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/))
- **Resend** — email delivery for contact form notifications (see [Resend's Privacy Policy](https://resend.com/legal/privacy-policy))

## Your Rights

Since LinkDen is self-hosted, you have complete control over all data. You can export, delete, or modify any data at any time through the admin panel or directly in your D1 database.

## Contact

For questions about this policy, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mrdemonwolf/linkden/issues).
