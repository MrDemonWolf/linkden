# Apple Wallet Pass

LinkDen can generate signed `.pkpass` files that visitors download and add to Apple Wallet on iOS and macOS. This creates a digital business card that lives in their wallet app alongside boarding passes and tickets.

## Prerequisites

To generate Apple Wallet passes, you need:

1. **Apple Developer Account** -- A paid Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year) at [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com).
2. **Pass Type Identifier** -- A unique identifier registered in the Apple Developer portal.
3. **Signing Certificates** -- A pass signing certificate and the Apple WWDR intermediate certificate.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Register a Pass Type ID

1. Log in to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com).
2. Navigate to **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Identifiers**.
3. Click the **+** button and select **Pass Type IDs**.
4. Enter a description (e.g., "LinkDen Business Card") and an identifier (e.g., `pass.com.yourdomain.linkden`).
5. Click **Register**.

### 2. Create a Signing Certificate

1. In the Apple Developer portal, go to **Certificates**.
2. Click **+** and select **Pass Type ID Certificate**.
3. Choose the Pass Type ID you just created.
4. Follow the instructions to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using Keychain Access on macOS.
5. Upload the CSR and download the certificate.
6. Double-click the downloaded `.cer` file to install it in Keychain Access.

### 3. Export the Certificate and Key

1. Open **Keychain Access** on macOS.
2. Find the pass certificate (it shows the Pass Type ID).
3. Expand it to see the private key.
4. Select both the certificate and key, right-click, and choose **Export 2 items**.
5. Save as `.p12` format with a passphrase.

### 4. Convert to Base64

Convert the certificates to base64 strings for environment variables:

```bash
# Download the Apple WWDR certificate
curl -O https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/AppleWWDRCAG4.cer

# Convert WWDR cert to base64
base64 -i AppleWWDRCAG4.cer | tr -d '\n' > wwdr_base64.txt

# Extract the signer certificate
openssl pkcs12 -in pass.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out signer_cert.pem
base64 -i signer_cert.pem | tr -d '\n' > signer_cert_base64.txt

# Extract the signer private key
openssl pkcs12 -in pass.p12 -nocerts -out signer_key.pem
base64 -i signer_key.pem | tr -d '\n' > signer_key_base64.txt
```

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

Add the following to `apps/server/.env`:

```bash
APPLE_PASS_TYPE_ID=pass.com.yourdomain.linkden
APPLE_TEAM_ID=YOUR_TEAM_ID
APPLE_WWDR_CERT=<contents of wwdr_base64.txt>
APPLE_SIGNER_CERT=<contents of signer_cert_base64.txt>
APPLE_SIGNER_KEY=<contents of signer_key_base64.txt>
APPLE_SIGNER_PASSPHRASE=your-p12-passphrase
```

### 6. Configure the Pass in the Admin Panel

Navigate to `/admin/wallet` to customize the pass appearance:

- **Card Title** -- The name shown on the pass.
- **Header Fields** -- Up to 3 fields shown at the top (e.g., job title, company).
- **Primary Fields** -- Your name as the main display.
- **Secondary Fields** -- Phone, email, website.
- **Back Fields** -- Additional info shown when the pass is flipped.
- **Colors** -- Background, foreground, and label colors.
- **Logo** -- Your logo displayed on the pass.

## Adding a Wallet Block

1. Go to `/admin/links`.
2. Click **Add New** and select the **Apple Wallet** block type.
3. Set a title (e.g., "Add to Apple Wallet").
4. Click **Save**.

The button appears on your public page. On iOS and macOS, tapping it downloads and prompts the user to add the pass to their wallet. On other platforms, the button is hidden or shows a fallback message.
