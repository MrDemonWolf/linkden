# Links & Blocks

LinkDen supports 5 block types that appear on your public page in the order you arrange them. All blocks are managed from the block builder at `/admin/builder`.

## Block Types

### Link

The most common block type. A clickable button that takes visitors to an external URL.

- **Title** -- The text displayed on the button.
- **URL** -- The destination URL.
- **Icon** -- Optional icon identifier.
- **Config options**: emoji, emoji position, icon slug, icon position, text alignment, font weight, outlined style, open in new tab.

### Header

A text heading that visually separates groups of blocks. Useful for organizing content into categories.

- **Title** -- The heading text.
- **Config options**: heading level (h1-h6), text alignment, font weight, emoji, emoji position, show divider line.

### Social Icons

A row of social media icon links. Uses the social networks you have activated in `/admin/social`.

### Embed

Embed content from external platforms directly on your page.

- **Embed Type** -- YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, or Custom.

### Contact Form

An inline contact form for visitors to send you messages.

Active networks become available for use in Social Icons blocks.
