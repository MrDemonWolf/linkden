# Links & Blocks

LinkDen supports multiple block types beyond simple links. Each block appears on your public page in the order you arrange them, and all are managed from the admin panel at `/admin/links`.

## Link Types

### Standard Link

The most common block type. A clickable button that takes visitors to an external URL.

- **Title** -- The text displayed on the button.
- **URL** -- The destination URL. Validated on save.
- **Icon** -- Optional brand icon from the 100+ built-in set (GitHub, Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, Discord, etc.).
- **New Tab** -- Whether the link opens in a new browser tab (default: yes).

### Email Link

Displays a `mailto:` link button. Visitors can tap to open their email client with your address pre-filled.

### Phone Link

Displays a `tel:` link button for one-tap calling on mobile devices.

### vCard Download

A button that downloads your digital business card as a `.vcf` file. Configure the vCard content in the [vCard settings](/docs/features/vcard).

### Apple Wallet Pass

A button that downloads a signed `.pkpass` file for adding your contact info to Apple Wallet on iOS and macOS. See the [Apple Wallet guide](/docs/features/apple-wallet) for setup.

## Block Types

### Heading

A text heading that visually separates groups of links. Useful for organizing links into categories like "Social", "Projects", or "Contact".

### Text Block

A paragraph of text displayed on your page. Supports basic formatting. Use it for bios, descriptions, or announcements.

### Spacer

An invisible block that adds vertical space between other blocks. Choose small, medium, or large spacing.

LinkDen includes 100+ predefined SVG brand icons. When creating or editing a link, you can search and select from icons including:

- **Social**: GitHub, Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, TikTok, YouTube, Twitch, Discord, Reddit, Telegram
- **Development**: Stack Overflow, CodePen, GitLab, Bitbucket, npm, Docker, VS Code

## Managing Links

2. Click **Add New** or navigate to `/admin/links/new`.
3. Select the block type (Link, Heading, Text, Spacer, Email, Phone, vCard, Wallet).
4. Fill in the fields and click **Save**.

### Reordering Links

Links support drag-and-drop reordering in the admin panel. Grab the handle on the left side of any link and drag it to a new position. The order updates automatically.

### Editing a Link

Click any link in the list to open the edit page. Make your changes and click **Save**.

### Deleting a Link

Open the link editor and click **Delete**. A confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion.

### Toggling Visibility

Each link has a visibility toggle. Hidden links are not shown on the public page but remain in your list for easy re-enabling.
