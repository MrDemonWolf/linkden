# Links & Blocks

LinkDen supports multiple block types beyond simple links. Each block appears on your public page in the order you arrange them, and all are managed from the admin panel at `/admin/links`.

## Link Types

### Standard Link

The most common block type. A clickable button that takes visitors to an external URL.

- **Title** -- The text displayed on the button.
- **URL** -- The destination URL. Validated on save.
- **Icon** -- Optional brand icon from the 100+ built-in set (GitHub, Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, Discord, etc.).
- **New Tab** -- Whether the link opens in a new browser tab (default: yes).

### Email Link

Displays a `mailto:` link button. Visitors can tap to open their email client with your address pre-filled.

### Phone Link

Displays a `tel:` link button for one-tap calling on mobile devices.

### vCard Download

A button that downloads your digital business card as a `.vcf` file. Configure the vCard content in the [vCard settings](/docs/features/vcard).

### Apple Wallet Pass

A button that downloads a signed `.pkpass` file for adding your contact info to Apple Wallet on iOS and macOS. See the [Apple Wallet guide](/docs/features/apple-wallet) for setup.

## Block Types

### Heading

A text heading that visually separates groups of links. Useful for organizing links into categories like "Social", "Projects", or "Contact".

### Text Block

A paragraph of text displayed on your page. Supports basic formatting. Use it for bios, descriptions, or announcements.

### Spacer

An invisible block that adds vertical space between other blocks. Choose small, medium, or large spacing.

## Brand Icons

LinkDen includes 100+ predefined SVG brand icons. When creating or editing a link, you can search and select from icons including:

- **Social**: GitHub, Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads, TikTok, YouTube, Twitch, Discord, Reddit, Telegram
- **Development**: Stack Overflow, CodePen, GitLab, Bitbucket, npm, Docker, VS Code
- **Creative**: Dribbble, Behance, Figma, DeviantArt, Unsplash
- **Music**: Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, Bandcamp
- **Business**: Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Shopify, Stripe, PayPal
- **Communication**: Email, Phone, WhatsApp, Signal, Slack
- And many more.

## Single-Instance Block Limits

Certain block types are limited to one instance per page because they represent a single piece of data or a unique UI element. Attempting to add a second instance of these blocks is prevented -- the block is greyed out in the picker once one is already on your page:

| Block Type | Limit | Reason |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Apple Wallet | 1 | One pass configuration per site |
| vCard Download | 1 | One vCard file per site |
| Contact Form | 1 | One contact form per page |

All other block types (Link, Heading, Text, Spacer, Email, Phone) can be added any number of times.

## Managing Links

### Adding a Block

1. Open the admin panel. The **Add Blocks** tab is shown by default in the left panel.
2. Use the **search bar** at the top of the panel to filter block types by name or description.
3. Click a block type to add it to the bottom of your list.
4. A slide-in animation confirms the block was added.

### Reordering Blocks

Drag-and-drop reordering works directly on the **phone preview** in the center panel. Grab any link card on the preview and drag it to a new position. The order updates live and the change is queued for the next publish. A drag handle icon appears on hover to indicate draggable items.

### Editing a Block

Click any block in the **Block List** tab of the left panel to open its edit form. Make your changes and click **Save**.

### Deleting a Block

Open the block edit form and click **Delete**. A confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion.

### Toggling Visibility

Each block has a visibility toggle switch in the block list. Hidden blocks are not shown on the public page but remain in your list for easy re-enabling. The toggle uses `role="switch"` and `aria-checked` for full accessibility.
