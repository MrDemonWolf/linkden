# Analytics

LinkDen includes a built-in analytics dashboard at `/admin/analytics` that tracks visitor activity without relying on third-party services.

## What is Tracked

### Page Views

Every visit to your public link page is recorded with a timestamp. The dashboard shows:

- **Total views** over all time.
- **Views today** for a quick pulse check.
- **Time-series chart** showing views over the last 7, 30, or 90 days.

### Link Clicks

Every click on a link button is tracked individually. You can see:

- **Total clicks** per link.
- **Click-through rate** (clicks / views).
- **Most popular links** ranked by click count.
- **Click trends** over time for each link.

### Referrers

The referring URL is captured for each page view, showing where your traffic comes from:

- Direct visits (no referrer).
- Social media platforms.
- Search engines.
- Other websites.

The referrer list is displayed as a ranked table with visit counts.

### Countries

Visitor country is determined from the Cloudflare `CF-IPCountry` header (no IP addresses are stored). The dashboard shows:

- A ranked list of countries by visit count.
- Percentage breakdown of traffic by country.

## Privacy

LinkDen's analytics are privacy-focused:

- **No cookies** are set for tracking.
- **No IP addresses** are stored. Country data comes from the Cloudflare header.
- **No third-party scripts** are loaded on the public page.
- **No fingerprinting** techniques are used.
- Data is stored in your own D1 database, not sent to any external service.

## Dashboard Views

The analytics dashboard provides several views:

- **Overview** -- Summary cards with key metrics and a combined chart.
- **Links** -- Per-link click data with sorting and filtering.
- **Referrers** -- Table of referral sources ranked by volume.
- **Countries** -- Geographic breakdown of visitors.
- **Time Range** -- Filter all data by last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, or all time.

## Data Retention

Analytics data is stored indefinitely in your D1 database. If you want to clear old data, you can use the export feature to back up the data first, then clear the analytics table from the admin settings.
