# Custom Pages

LinkDen supports custom pages for content like privacy policies, terms of service, and any other pages you need. Pages are written in Markdown and rendered as styled HTML at `/p/{slug}`.

## Built-in Static Pages

LinkDen includes two hardcoded static pages:

- **Privacy Policy** at `/privacy`
- **Terms of Service** at `/terms`

These are always available and do not require database configuration.

## Custom Pages

Custom pages created through the admin panel are served at `/p/{slug}` (for example, `/p/about` or `/p/faq`).

### Creating a Page

1. Navigate to `/admin/pages` in the admin panel.
2. Click **New Page**.
3. Enter a **Title** (e.g., "About Me").
4. Set the **Slug** (e.g., `about`). This determines the URL path (`/p/about`).
5. Write the page content using **Markdown** syntax.
6. Toggle **Published** to make the page live.
7. Click **Create Page**.

### Markdown Support

Page content is written in Markdown and supports GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) via `remark-gfm`:

- **Headings** (`# H1` through `###### H6`)
- **Bold** (`**text**`) and *italic* (`*text*`)
- **Links** (`[text](url)`)
- **Lists** (ordered and unordered)
- **Code blocks** with syntax highlighting
- **Tables** (GFM pipe tables)
- **Strikethrough** (`~~text~~`)
- **Task lists** (`- [x] done`)

### Editing a Page

Click any page in the list to open the editor. Make your changes and click **Save**. Changes are reflected immediately on the public site (cached responses are purged automatically).

### Deleting a Page

Open the page editor and click **Delete**. Click again within 3 seconds to confirm the deletion.

## SEO

Each custom page includes proper heading hierarchy for search engine crawlers. The page title is used as the document title.
