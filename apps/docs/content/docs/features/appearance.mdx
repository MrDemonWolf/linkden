# Appearance

The appearance settings at `/admin/appearance` let you customize the visual look of your public link page beyond the base theme.

## Theme Presets

Choose from 7 built-in theme presets. Each preset defines a complete color palette for both light and dark modes. See the [Themes](/docs/features/themes) page for details on each theme.

## Color Customization

Override individual theme colors:

- **Primary color** -- The main accent color used for buttons and interactive elements.
- **Secondary color** -- Supporting color for secondary elements.
- **Accent color** -- Highlight color for emphasis.
- **Background color** -- Override the page background.

Colors are set via CSS custom properties (`--ld-primary`, `--ld-secondary`, etc.) and apply on top of the selected theme preset.

## Default Color Mode

Set the default color mode for visitors:

- **Light** -- Forces the light variant.
- **Dark** -- Forces the dark variant.
- **System** -- Follows the visitor's OS preference.

Visitors can always toggle between light and dark mode using the theme toggle button on the public page.

## Custom CSS

For advanced customization, add custom CSS that is injected into your public page. This lets you:

- Override any theme variable or style.
- Add animations or transitions.
- Style specific elements with custom selectors.
- Implement completely unique designs.

## Dark / Light Mode Toggle

Visitors to your public page can switch between dark and light mode using the theme toggle button. The initial mode is determined by:

1. The visitor's saved preference (stored in `localStorage`).
2. Your site's default color mode setting.
3. The visitor's OS-level color scheme preference if "system" is selected.

## Whitelabel

Toggle off all LinkDen branding with a single switch in `/admin/settings` under the **Branding** section:

- Removes the "Powered by LinkDen" footer.
- Optionally shows custom footer text and link instead.
- No attribution is required under the MIT license.
