# Appearance

The appearance settings at `/admin/appearance` let you customize every visual aspect of your public link page beyond the base theme.

## Branding

### Profile Image

Upload a profile image that appears at the top of your link page. Supports JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats. Images are automatically resized and optimized.

### Display Name

The name shown below your profile image. This is typically your name, brand name, or handle.

### Bio

A short description that appears below your display name. Use it for a tagline, job title, or brief introduction.

### Favicon

Upload a custom favicon for your link page. This replaces the default browser tab icon. Supports ICO, PNG, and SVG formats.

## Colors

### Primary Color

The main accent color used for link buttons, active states, and interactive elements. Set via a color picker or by entering a hex value directly.

### Background Color

Override the theme's default background color. Useful when you want to keep a theme's layout but match your brand colors exactly.

### Text Color

Override the default text color for headings, body text, and link labels.

## Button Styles

Choose how link buttons are rendered:

- **Filled** -- Solid background with the primary color. White text.
- **Outlined** -- Transparent background with a border in the primary color.
- **Soft** -- Light tinted background using the primary color at low opacity.

You can also adjust the button border radius from sharp corners to fully rounded pills.

## Background

### Background Image

Upload a background image that covers the entire page. The image is fixed and centered with `cover` sizing. A semi-transparent overlay ensures text readability.

### Background Gradient

Apply a CSS gradient as the background. Enter any valid CSS gradient value (e.g., `linear-gradient(135deg, #091533, #1a2a6c)`).

## Fonts

### Google Fonts

Enter a Google Fonts family name (e.g., `Inter`, `Poppins`, `JetBrains Mono`) and it is automatically loaded on your public page. You can set separate fonts for headings and body text.

## Custom CSS

For advanced customization, add custom CSS that is injected into your public page. This lets you:

- Override any theme styles.
- Add animations or transitions.
- Style specific elements with custom selectors.
- Implement completely unique designs.

The CSS editor in the admin panel includes syntax highlighting and live preview.

## Whitelabel

Toggle off all LinkDen branding with a single switch:

- Removes the "Powered by LinkDen" footer.
- Removes the LinkDen favicon (uses your custom one instead).
- No attribution is required under the MIT license.

Access this setting at `/admin/settings` under the Branding section.
