# Themes

LinkDen ships with 8 built-in themes, each available in dark and light variants (16 total). An auto mode follows the visitor's system preference.

## Available Themes

### Default
A clean, minimal design with a white background (light) or dark gray background (dark). Neutral colors that work for any brand.

### Midnight Glass
A premium dark theme with deep navy (#091533) background and cyan (#0FACED) accents. Frosted glass card effects with subtle backdrop blur.

### Minimal
Ultra-clean with maximum whitespace. No card backgrounds, just text and simple dividers. Perfect for a typographic, portfolio-style page.

### Neon
Bold neon accents on a dark background. Link buttons glow on hover. Eye-catching and modern.

### Pastel
Soft pastel colors with rounded corners and gentle shadows. Warm and approachable feel.

### Brutalist
Raw, unpolished aesthetic with thick borders, monospace fonts, and high contrast. Stands out from typical link pages.

### Gradient
Background uses a smooth color gradient that you can customize. Links are semi-transparent with blur effects.

### Terminal
Monospace font, green-on-black color scheme, command-prompt styling. For developers and tech enthusiasts.

## Selecting a Theme

1. Navigate to `/admin/appearance` in the admin panel.
2. Browse the theme gallery with live previews.
3. Click a theme to select it.
4. Choose the color mode: **Light**, **Dark**, or **Auto**.
5. Click **Save**.

## Color Modes

Each theme supports three modes:

- **Light** -- Forces the light variant regardless of system preference.
- **Dark** -- Forces the dark variant regardless of system preference.
- **Auto** -- Follows the visitor's operating system preference. If the visitor uses dark mode, they see the dark variant; otherwise, the light variant.

## Customizing Themes

While each theme has a curated default palette, you can further customize through the [Appearance](/docs/features/appearance) settings:

- Override primary and accent colors with the color picker.
- Change button styles (filled, outlined, soft).
- Set custom background images or gradients.
- Apply custom CSS for fine-grained control.
- Use Google Fonts to change the typeface.

These customizations layer on top of the selected theme, so you get the base layout and feel of the theme with your own color adjustments.
