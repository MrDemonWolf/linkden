# Welcome to LinkDen

LinkDen is a self-hosted link-in-bio platform that replaces heavy PHP frameworks with modern TypeScript tooling. Built on the Cloudflare stack, it delivers blazing-fast page loads and full customization through a polished admin panel.

## What is LinkDen?

LinkDen gives you a single-user link page at your root URL. Visitors land directly on your links with no registration or multi-user overhead. Behind the scenes, a full admin panel lets you manage every aspect of your page.

**Your links, your brand, your rules.**

## Key Highlights

- **Edge Performance** — Static pages served from Cloudflare Pages with API on Workers and D1 SQLite for sub-second load times worldwide.
- **Full Admin Panel** — Manage blocks, appearance, analytics, vCard, and Apple Wallet passes from a polished dashboard with its own Light/Dark/System theme toggle.
- **7 Built-in Themes** — Each theme ships with dark and light variants (14 total) plus auto mode. Admin and public page themes are independent.
- **5 Block Types** — Link, Header, Social Icons, Embed, and Contact Form blocks with rich configuration options and structured Zod-validated config.
- **Banner System** — Choose from preset gradients that adapt to your theme colors, or upload a custom banner image.
- **100+ Social Brands** — Predefined icons with combobox search, horizontal category filters, and automatic contrast-aware ring borders for dark icons.
- **Security First** — XSS protection via server-side HTML stripping, URL validation, CSS sanitization, and a secure one-time setup token.
- **Apple Wallet** — Generate signed `.pkpass` files for iPhone contact cards.
- **Whitelabel** — Toggle off all LinkDen branding with a single setting. MIT license, no attribution required.
- **Export/Import** — Back up all data as JSON.
