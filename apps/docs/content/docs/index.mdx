# Welcome to LinkDen

LinkDen is a self-hosted link-in-bio platform that replaces heavy PHP frameworks with modern TypeScript tooling. Built on the Cloudflare stack, it delivers blazing-fast page loads and full customization through a polished admin panel.

## What is LinkDen?

LinkDen gives you a single-user link page at your root URL. Visitors land directly on your links with no registration or multi-user overhead. Behind the scenes, a full admin panel lets you manage every aspect of your page.

**Your links, your brand, your rules.**

## Key Highlights

- **Edge Performance** -- Static pages served from Cloudflare Pages with API on Workers and D1 SQLite for sub-second load times worldwide.
- **Full Admin Panel** -- Manage links, appearance, analytics, vCard, and Apple Wallet passes from a macOS-inspired dashboard.
- **8 Built-in Themes** -- Each theme ships with dark and light variants (16 total) plus auto mode.
- **100+ Brand Icons** -- Predefined SVG icons for GitHub, Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, Discord, and dozens more.
- **Apple Wallet** -- Generate signed `.pkpass` files for iPhone contact cards.
- **Whitelabel** -- Toggle off all LinkDen branding with a single setting. MIT license, no attribution required.
- **Export/Import** -- Back up all data as JSON or migrate from LinkStack.
