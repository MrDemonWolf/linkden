# Contact Form

Let visitors send you messages without exposing your email address. Messages are stored in your database and optionally forwarded to your inbox.

## How It Works

1. A visitor fills out the form on your public page (name, email, message).
2. If CAPTCHA is configured, it verifies the submission is from a real person.
3. The message is saved to your database.
4. If email is configured, you receive a notification with the full submission details.
5. You can view and manage all submissions at `/admin/contacts`.

## Setting Up

### 1. Enable the Form

Go to `/admin/settings` and find the **Contact Form** section. Toggle it on and choose a delivery mode:

- **Database only** -- Messages are stored but no emails are sent.
- **Email notification** -- Messages are stored and you receive an email.
- **Database + email** -- Both storage and email notification.

### 2. Configure Email (Optional)

Under the **Email** section in `/admin/settings`:

1. Select a provider: **Resend** or **Cloudflare Email Workers**.
2. Enter your API key.
3. Set the "From" email address (must be verified with your provider).

When email is enabled, LinkDen sends a **Contact Notification** email to you with the full submission details (name, email, message, and any optional fields). You can preview this template in the [Email Templates](/docs/guide/email-templates) section.

### 3. Configure CAPTCHA (Recommended)

Under the **CAPTCHA** section in `/admin/settings`, choose a provider:

**Cloudflare Turnstile** -- A privacy-friendly, invisible challenge.

1. Go to **Turnstile** in the Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Add your site and get the site key and secret key.
3. Enter both keys in the CAPTCHA settings.

**Google reCAPTCHA** -- A traditional checkbox challenge.

1. Register your site at [google.com/recaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha).
2. Get the site key and secret key.
3. Enter both keys in the CAPTCHA settings.

> **Tip:** Without CAPTCHA, the form still works but has no bot protection. Turnstile is recommended for a frictionless visitor experience.

## Managing Submissions

Navigate to `/admin/contacts` to view all submissions. Each one shows:

- Sender name and email
- Message content
- Date and time
- Read/unread status

You can **mark as read**, **mark as unread**, or **delete** any submission.

The dashboard at `/admin` shows an **Unread Contacts** stat card with a quick link to your messages.
