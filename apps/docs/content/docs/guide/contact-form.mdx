# Contact Form

LinkDen includes an optional contact form that lets visitors send you messages without exposing your email address. Messages are stored in the database and optionally delivered to your inbox via email.

## How It Works

1. A visitor fills out the contact form on your public page (name, email, message).
2. CAPTCHA validates the submission is from a real person (if configured).
3. The message is saved to your D1 database.
4. If email is configured, a notification is sent to your address and a confirmation is sent to the visitor.
5. You can view and manage all submissions in the admin panel at `/admin/contacts`.

## Email Templates

LinkDen includes two email templates built with React Email:

- **Contact Notification** -- Sent to you (the admin) with the full submission details: name, email, message, and optional fields (subject, phone, company).
- **Contact Confirmation** -- Sent to the visitor confirming their message was received.

You can preview these templates in the [Email Templates](/emails) section of this documentation.

## Setting Up the Contact Form

### Enable the Form

Toggle the contact form on or off in `/admin/settings` under the **Contact Form** section. Choose the delivery mode:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Database only | Messages are stored but no emails are sent |
| Email notification | Messages are stored and you receive an email notification |
| Database + email | Both storage and email notification |

### Configure Email (for notifications)

In `/admin/settings` under the **Email** section:

1. Select a provider: **Resend** or **Cloudflare Email Workers**.
2. Enter your API key.
3. Set the "From" email address (must be verified with your provider).

### Configure CAPTCHA (Recommended)

In `/admin/settings` under the **CAPTCHA** section, select a provider:

#### Cloudflare Turnstile

Privacy-friendly, invisible challenge from Cloudflare.

1. Go to **Turnstile** in the Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Add your site and get the site key and secret key.
3. Enter both keys in the CAPTCHA settings.

#### Google reCAPTCHA

Traditional checkbox CAPTCHA from Google.

1. Register your site at [google.com/recaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha).
2. Get the site key and secret key.
3. Enter both keys in the CAPTCHA settings.

Without any CAPTCHA configured, the form works but has no bot protection.

## Managing Submissions

Navigate to `/admin/contacts` to view all form submissions. Each submission shows:

- Sender name and email.
- Message content.
- Submission date and time.
- Read/unread status.

Available actions:

- **Mark as read** / **Mark as unread** -- Toggle the read status.
- **Delete** -- Permanently remove a submission.

The dashboard at `/admin` shows an **Unread Contacts** stat card with a direct link to the contacts page.

## Form Fields

The contact form includes:

| Field | Type | Required |
|-------|------|----------|
| Name | Text | Yes |
| Email | Email | Yes |
| Message | Textarea | Yes |
| CAPTCHA | Turnstile / reCAPTCHA | If configured |
