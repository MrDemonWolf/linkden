# Export & Import

LinkDen provides full data portability through JSON export and import. Back up your configuration, migrate between instances, or import from LinkStack.

## Exporting Data

Navigate to `/admin/settings` and scroll to the **Export** section.

### What is Exported

The export file includes all of your LinkDen data:

- **Links** -- All links and blocks with their order, visibility, and settings.
- **Appearance** -- Theme selection, colors, fonts, button styles, and custom CSS.
- **Profile** -- Display name, bio, and profile image reference.
- **vCard** -- All vCard fields and configuration.
- **Wallet** -- Apple Wallet pass configuration (not certificates).
- **Pages** -- Custom pages (privacy policy, terms, etc.).
- **Settings** -- General settings including whitelabel toggle.

### How to Export

1. Go to `/admin/settings`.
2. Click **Export Data**.
3. A JSON file downloads to your device.
4. Store the file securely as a backup.

The exported file does not include:

- Analytics data (page views, clicks).
- Uploaded images (profile photo, favicon, background).
- Environment variables or secrets.

## Importing Data

### LinkDen Format

To import a LinkDen export:

1. Go to `/admin/settings`.
2. Click **Import Data**.
3. Select your JSON export file.
4. Review the import summary showing what will be created or updated.
5. Click **Confirm Import**.

Importing overwrites existing data for matching records. New records are created for items that do not exist.

### LinkStack Migration

LinkDen supports importing from [LinkStack](https://linkstack.org/), making it easy to migrate:

1. Export your data from LinkStack (JSON format).
2. Go to `/admin/settings` in LinkDen.
3. Click **Import Data** and select the LinkStack export file.
4. LinkDen automatically detects the LinkStack format and maps the fields.
5. Review the import summary and click **Confirm Import**.

The LinkStack importer maps:

| LinkStack Field | LinkDen Field |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Links | Links (standard type) |
| Title | Display name |
| Bio | Bio |
| Theme | Closest matching theme |

Some LinkStack features may not have direct equivalents. The import summary highlights any fields that could not be mapped.

## Best Practices

- **Export before updating** -- Always create a backup before pulling new versions.
- **Export before importing** -- Create a backup of your current data before importing.
- **Store exports securely** -- Export files contain your complete link configuration.
- **Regular backups** -- Schedule periodic exports for disaster recovery.
