# Analytics

See how your page is performing at `/admin/analytics`. LinkDen tracks visitor activity without relying on third-party services -- all data stays in your own database.

## Dashboard Overview

### Time Period

Filter all data by **7 days** (default), **30 days**, or **90 days**. Changing the period updates every chart and stat on the page.

### Stat Cards

Two cards at the top give you the big picture:

- **Total Views** -- Page views for the selected period.
- **Total Clicks** -- Link clicks for the selected period.

### Views Over Time

A bar chart showing daily page views. Hover over any bar to see the exact count for that day.

### Top Links, Referrers, and Countries

Three cards below the chart break down your traffic:

- **Top Links** -- Your most-clicked links ranked by click count (top 10).
- **Referrers** -- Where your visitors are coming from. Direct visits (no referrer) show as "Direct" (top 10).
- **Countries** -- Which countries your visitors are in (top 20).

## What Gets Tracked

**Page views** record the timestamp, referrer, and visitor country each time someone visits your public page.

**Link clicks** record which link was clicked, the referrer, and visitor country.

## Privacy

LinkDen's analytics are designed to respect your visitors' privacy:

- No cookies are set for tracking.
- No IP addresses are stored. Country data comes from Cloudflare's request header.
- No third-party scripts are loaded on the public page.
- No fingerprinting techniques are used.
- All data lives in your own database and is never sent to an external service.

## Home Page Summary

The admin home page at `/admin` also shows a mini chart with views over the last 7 days, plus quick stats for total views, total clicks, and unread contacts.
