# Analytics

LinkDen includes a built-in analytics dashboard at `/admin/analytics` that tracks visitor activity without relying on third-party services.

## Dashboard

### Period Selector

Filter all analytics data by time period:

- **7 days** (default)
- **30 days**
- **90 days**

All queries re-run when the period changes.

### Stat Cards

Two summary cards displayed in a 2-column grid:

| Card | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Total Views | Eye (blue) | Page views for the selected period |
| Total Clicks | MousePointerClick (green) | Link clicks for the selected period |

### Views Over Time

A bar chart showing daily page views for the selected period. Bars highlight on hover and show the count. Date labels display month and day (e.g., "Feb 23").

### Bottom Grid

Three cards in a 3-column layout (stacks to 1 column on mobile):

| Card | Description | Limit |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Top Links** | Block title, URL, and click count ranked by clicks | Top 10 |
| **Referrers** | Referrer domain and count ("Direct" for null referrers) | Top 10 |
| **Countries** | Country name and visit count | Top 20 |

## What is Tracked

### Page Views

Every visit to your public link page is recorded with:
- Timestamp
- Referrer URL
- User agent
- Country (from Cloudflare `CF-IPCountry` header)

### Link Clicks

Every click on a link block is tracked with:
- Block ID
- Referrer URL
- User agent
- Country

## Privacy

LinkDen's analytics are privacy-focused:

- **No cookies** are set for tracking.
- **No IP addresses** are stored. Country data comes from the Cloudflare header.
- **No third-party scripts** are loaded on the public page.
- **No fingerprinting** techniques are used.
- Data is stored in your own D1 database, not sent to any external service.

## Dashboard on Home Page

The admin dashboard at `/admin` also shows a mini bar chart with views over the last 7 days, plus 3 stat cards (total views, total clicks, unread contacts). The full analytics page provides more detailed breakdowns.

## Data Retention

Analytics data is stored indefinitely in your D1 database. Use the export feature in settings to back up data if needed.
