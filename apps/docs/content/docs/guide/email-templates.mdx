# Email Templates

LinkDen uses a single email template for contact form notifications. It's built with [React Email](https://react.email) so it renders consistently across all major email clients.

## Contact Notification

When a visitor submits your contact form, you receive a **Contact Notification** email with the full submission details:

- Sender name and email address
- Message content
- Optional fields: subject line, phone number, and company name

The email uses a clean, branded layout with your LinkDen logo in the header and a light footer.

## Setting Up Email Delivery

To receive contact form emails, configure an email provider in **Settings > Email**:

1. Choose **Resend** or **Cloudflare Email Workers** as your provider.
2. Enter your API key.
3. Set your "From" email address (must be verified with the provider).
4. Under **Contact Form**, set the delivery mode to include email notifications.

See the [Contact Form guide](/docs/guide/contact-form) for full setup instructions.
