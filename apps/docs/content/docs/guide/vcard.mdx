# vCard

LinkDen lets you create a digital business card that visitors can download as a `.vcf` file. The vCard is compatible with all major contact apps on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.

## Enabling vCard

Toggle the vCard download button in `/admin/settings` under the **vCard** section. When enabled, a download button appears on your public page.

## Configuring vCard Data

The vCard data is managed through the `vcard.updateConfig` API. Available fields:

### Personal Information

- **Full Name** -- Your name as it should appear in contacts.
- **Nickname** -- An optional alternative name or handle.
- **Birthday** -- Optional birthday field.
- **Photo** -- Profile photo URL.

### Professional Information

- **Organization** -- Your company or organization name.
- **Title** -- Your role or position.
- **Department** -- Optional department within the organization.

### Contact Details

### URLs

## vCard Format

LinkDen generates vCard 3.0 format files, which have the widest compatibility across devices and applications. The generated file includes all fields you have filled in and omits empty fields.

## Preview

You can preview the generated `.vcf` output using the `vcard.preview` API procedure, which returns the raw VCard string.
