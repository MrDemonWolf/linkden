# Appearance & Themes

Everything visual about your public page lives at `/admin/appearance`. Changes preview instantly in the phone preview on the right — click **Publish** when you're happy, or **Discard** to revert.

## Theme Presets

Pick from 7 built-in themes. Each has a dark and light variant (14 total), plus an auto mode that follows the visitor's device preference.

| Theme | Primary Color | Vibe |
|-------|--------------|------|
| **Default** | Cyan `#0FACED` | Clean, modern |
| **Corporate Classic** | Navy `#1E3A5F` | Professional, subtle |
| **Corporate Modern** | Teal `#0D9488` | Contemporary, balanced |
| **Hacker Terminal** | Green `#16A34A` | Monospace, sharp corners |
| **Neon Cyber** | Purple `#7C3AED` | Vibrant, large radius |
| **Furry Pastel** | Pink `#EC4899` | Warm, fully rounded |
| **Furry Bold** | Orange `#EA580C` | High energy, bold |

Click any theme card to apply it. The color pickers update to match the theme's palette.

## Custom Colors

Override individual colors on top of any preset:

- **Primary** — Main accent for buttons and links
- **Secondary** — Supporting elements
- **Accent** — Highlights and emphasis
- **Background** — Page background

Each color has a hex input and a native color swatch side by side. Custom overrides apply in light mode only — dark mode uses the full preset-defined palette to avoid contrast issues.

## Color Mode

Set the default mode visitors see:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Light** | Always shows the light variant |
| **Dark** | Always shows the dark variant |
| **System** | Matches the visitor's OS preference |

Visitors can always toggle between light and dark using the button on your page. Their preference is saved in the browser for return visits.

## Admin vs. Public Themes

The admin panel and public page have **separate** theming systems. Choosing "Neon Cyber" for your public page won't turn your admin panel purple.

- **Admin theme** — Light / Dark / System toggle in the appearance page. Uses standard Tailwind dark mode.
- **Public theme** — Preset + custom colors + color mode, stored in the database and applied via CSS custom properties.

## Profile

Customize what visitors see at the top of your page:

- **Avatar** — Upload an image or provide a URL
- **Display Name** — Up to 50 characters
- **Bio** — Short description, up to 300 characters (character counter shown)

## Banners

Add a banner behind your avatar. Two modes:

### Preset Gradients

Gradient presets that adapt to your current theme colors. Change your theme or custom colors and the gradients update automatically.

### Custom Image

Upload any image as a custom banner. Not affected by theme changes.

Toggle the banner on or off with the switch.

## Verified Badge

Toggle a blue checkmark next to your display name. Purely cosmetic — no external verification needed.

## Branding / Whitelabel

Control the footer on your public page:

- **Show footer** — Toggle on or off
- **Custom Text** — Replace the default "Powered by LinkDen" text
- **Custom Link** — Set a URL for the footer link

## Custom CSS

Add your own CSS to the public page for advanced customization. The CSS is sanitized server-side to prevent XSS (script tags, `expression()`, `javascript:` URLs are stripped).
