# Appearance

The appearance page at `/admin/appearance` controls everything visual about your public link page. All changes use a preview-first workflow -- you can see the effect of each change in the live phone preview before publishing.

## Preview-First Workflow

The Appearance page uses a **Publish / Discard** model:

1. Make changes to any setting (theme, colors, banner, etc.).
2. See changes reflected instantly in the phone preview on the right.
3. Click **Publish** to save all changes at once, or **Discard** to revert.

The subtitle shows "Unsaved changes -- publish to go live" when you have pending changes, and "Your page is up to date" when everything is saved.

## Admin Theme

The admin panel has its own theme toggle, separate from the public page. Choose between:

- **Light** -- Light admin panel.
- **Dark** -- Dark admin panel.
- **System** -- Follows your OS preference.

This setting uses `next-themes` and only affects the admin panel. Public page theme presets do not leak into the admin UI, and vice versa. See [Theming](/docs/guide/theming) for details on the separation between admin and public themes.

---

## Profile Section

The profile section uses a centered layout with the avatar above full-width name and bio fields:

- **Avatar** -- Upload an image or provide a URL. The avatar is displayed centered above the name and bio.
- **Display Name** -- Up to 50 characters.
- **Bio** -- A short description, up to 300 characters. A character counter is shown in the top-right corner of the field.

## Theme Presets

Choose from 7 built-in themes, each available in dark and light variants (14 total). An auto mode follows the visitor's system preference.

### Available Themes

| Theme | Color | Style |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Default** | Cyan (`#0FACED`) | Clean, modern, medium border radius |
| **Corporate Classic** | Navy (`#1E3A5F`) | Professional, subtle border radius |
| **Corporate Modern** | Teal (`#0D9488`) | Contemporary, balanced border radius |
| **Hacker Terminal** | Green (`#16A34A`) | Monospace-inspired, no border radius |
| **Neon Cyber** | Purple (`#7C3AED`) | Eye-catching, large border radius |
| **Furry Pastel** | Pink (`#EC4899`) | Warm, fully rounded corners |
| **Furry Bold** | Orange (`#EA580C`) | High energy, large border radius |

Click any theme to select it. The color pickers update automatically to match the theme's palette.

## Color Customization

Override individual theme colors:

- **Primary color** -- The main accent color used for buttons and interactive elements.
- **Secondary color** -- Supporting color for secondary elements.
- **Accent color** -- Highlight color for emphasis.
- **Background color** -- Override the page background.

Colors are set via CSS custom properties (`--ld-primary`, `--ld-secondary`, etc.) and apply on top of the selected theme preset. Custom color overrides are stored as light-mode values and apply only in light mode; dark mode uses the full theme-defined palette.

## Default Color Mode

Set the default color mode for visitors on the **public page**:

- **Light** -- Forces the light variant.
- **Dark** -- Forces the dark variant.
- **System** -- Follows the visitor's OS preference.

When "System" is selected, the preview panel correctly detects your current OS preference to show an accurate preview. Visitors can always toggle between light and dark mode using the theme toggle button on the public page.

## Banner

The banner system supports two modes, toggled with Presets / Custom Image tabs:

### Preset Gradients

Choose from gradient presets that automatically adapt to your current theme colors. The presets use your primary, accent, and background colors to generate themed gradients, so they update when you change themes or custom colors.

### Custom Image Upload

Upload a custom banner image. The image upload field accepts standard image formats and displays a preview of your uploaded banner.

### Banner Settings

- **Enable/disable** -- Toggle the banner on or off with a switch.
- **Mode toggle** -- Switch between "Presets" and "Custom Image" tabs.
- The banner appears behind your avatar on the public page.

## Verified Badge

Toggle a blue checkmark badge that appears next to your display name on the public page. This is purely cosmetic and does not require any external verification.

## Branding

Control the whitelabel footer on your public page:

- **Show whitelabel footer** -- Toggle the footer on/off.
- **Custom Text** -- Replace the default "Powered by LinkDen" text.
- **Custom Link** -- Set a custom URL for the footer link.

When disabled, no footer is shown at all. LinkDen is MIT licensed, so no attribution is required.

## Custom CSS

For advanced customization, add custom CSS that is injected into your public page. This lets you override any theme variable or style, add animations, or implement completely unique designs. Custom CSS is sanitized server-side to prevent XSS injection (script tags, `expression()`, `javascript:` URLs, and other vectors are stripped).

### Available CSS Classes

| `.ld-page` | Page container |
| `.ld-profile` | Profile/header section |

  border-radius: 20px;
}

/* Custom gradient background */
.ld-page {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--ld-primary), var(--ld-accent));
}
```

## Dark / Light Mode Toggle

Visitors to your public page can switch between dark and light mode using the theme toggle button. The initial mode is determined by:

1. The visitor's saved preference (stored in `localStorage`).
2. Your site's default color mode setting.
3. The visitor's OS-level color scheme preference if "system" is selected.
