# Social Networks

LinkDen includes 100+ predefined social network icons from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/). Social networks are managed separately from blocks at `/admin/social`.

## Managing Social Networks

Navigate to `/admin/social` to see all available social networks. The page provides several tools for finding and managing networks:

### Combobox Search

A searchable dropdown (combobox) lets you quickly find any network by typing its name. Start typing and matching networks appear instantly, making it easy to locate specific platforms from the full catalog of 100+ icons.

### Category Filter Tabs

Horizontal pill-style tabs group networks by category:

- **All** -- Show every available network.
- **Social** -- Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon, etc.
- **Video** -- YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo.
- **Music** -- Spotify, SoundCloud, Apple Music, Bandcamp.
- **Development** -- GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Stack Overflow, CodePen.
- **Professional** -- LinkedIn, Dribbble, Behance.
- **Messaging** -- Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal.
- **Gaming** -- Steam, Epic Games, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo.
- **Other** -- Reddit, Pinterest, Medium, Substack, Patreon, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, and more.

Click a tab to filter the list to that category.

### Toggle and URL Entry

Each network has a toggle switch and a URL field. Toggle a network on to activate it, then enter the URL for your profile on that platform. Networks with empty URLs show a guard prompt when toggled on.

### Auto-Invert Dark Icons

Brand icons that are too dark to see against a dark background are automatically inverted in dark mode. This ensures all icons remain visible regardless of the admin panel's theme setting, without requiring manual adjustments.

### Fixed Dark Mode Text

Network names and labels use proper contrast colors in dark mode, fixing previous readability issues.

## Using Social Icons

Once you have activated the networks you want:

1. Go to `/admin/builder`.
2. Click **Add Block** and select **Social Icons**.
3. The block automatically uses your active social networks.
4. Configure the display options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Icon size | Size of each social icon |
| Icon style | Filled, outlined, or rounded |
| Show labels | Display the network name below each icon |
| Spacing | Gap between icons |
