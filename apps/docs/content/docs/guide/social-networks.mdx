# Social Networks

LinkDen includes 100+ social network icons from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/). Manage them at `/admin/social`, then display them on your page with a Social Icons block.

## Finding and Activating Networks

### Search

Use the search box to quickly find any network by name.

### Category Tabs

Filter networks by category:

- **Social** -- Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon, etc.
- **Video** -- YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo.
- **Music** -- Spotify, SoundCloud, Apple Music, Bandcamp.
- **Development** -- GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Stack Overflow, CodePen.
- **Professional** -- LinkedIn, Dribbble, Behance.
- **Messaging** -- Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal.
- **Gaming** -- Steam, Epic Games, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo.
- **Other** -- Reddit, Pinterest, Medium, Substack, Patreon, Ko-fi, and more.

### Toggle and URL

Each network has a toggle switch and a URL field. Turn a network on, then enter the URL to your profile on that platform.

> **Tip:** Dark brand icons are automatically inverted in dark mode so they stay visible regardless of your theme.

## Adding Social Icons to Your Page

Once you've activated the networks you want:

1. Go to `/admin/builder`.
2. Click **Add Block** and select **Social Icons**.
3. The block automatically pulls in your active networks.
4. Customize the display:
