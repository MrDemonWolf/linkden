# Social Networks

LinkDen includes 100+ predefined social network icons from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/). Social networks are managed separately from blocks at `/admin/social`.

## Managing Social Networks

Navigate to `/admin/social` to see all available social networks. The page lets you:

- **Search** networks by name or slug.
- **Filter** to show all networks or only active ones.
- **Toggle** networks on/off with a switch.

Active networks become available for use in **Social Icons** blocks.

## Using Social Icons

Once you've activated the networks you want:

1. Go to `/admin/builder`.
2. Click **Add Block** and select **Social Icons**.
3. The block automatically uses your active social networks.
4. Configure the display options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Icon size | Size of each social icon |
| Icon style | Filled, outlined, or rounded |
| Show labels | Display the network name below each icon |
| Spacing | Gap between icons |
| Use brand colors | Use each network's official brand color |

- **Social**: Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon
- **Video**: YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo

## Icon Updates

Social brand icons are sourced from the `@linkden/ui` package. The icon set is checked weekly via a GitHub Actions workflow that detects when new icons are available from Simple Icons.
