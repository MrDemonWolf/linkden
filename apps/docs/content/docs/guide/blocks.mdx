# Blocks

Build your page by adding blocks in the builder at `/admin/builder`. LinkDen supports 5 block types that you can mix, match, and reorder however you like.

## Block Types

### Link

A clickable button that sends visitors to any URL. This is the most common block type.

- **Title** -- The button text visitors see.
- **URL** -- Where the button links to.
- **Icon** -- Optional icon displayed alongside the title.
- **Style options** -- emoji, text alignment, font weight, outlined style, open in new tab.

### Header

A text heading to visually separate groups of blocks.

- **Title** -- The heading text.
- **Style options** -- heading level (h1--h6), text alignment, font weight, emoji, show divider line.

### Social Icons

A row of social media icons linking to your profiles. Uses the networks you've activated in `/admin/social`. See [Social Networks](/docs/guide/social-networks) for setup.

- **Style options** -- icon size, icon style (filled, outlined, rounded), show labels, spacing, use brand colors.

### Embed

Embed content from YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, or any custom URL directly on your page.

- **Embed Type** -- YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, or Custom.
- **Embed URL** -- The content URL to embed.
- **Style options** -- aspect ratio, max width, show title.

### Contact Form

An inline contact form so visitors can message you without leaving your page.

- **Style options** -- button text, button emoji, success message.

> **Tip:** The contact form requires setup in `/admin/settings` first. See [Contact Form](/docs/guide/contact-form) for details.

## Adding a Block

1. Open the builder at `/admin/builder`.
2. Click **Add Block** to open the dropdown.
3. Select a block type.
4. The block appears and its edit panel opens automatically.

## Editing a Block

Click edit on any block to open a slide-in panel with 4 tabs:

### Content Tab

Set the block's core fields -- title, URL, embed type, and embed URL vary depending on the block type.

### Style Tab

Customize the block's appearance with an icon and advanced style settings.

### Options Tab

Quick reference for common options like `noFollow`, `newTab`, `animation`, and `thumbnail`.

### Schedule Tab

Set a start and end date to control when the block is visible. Blocks outside their scheduled window are automatically hidden from visitors.

Use the **Clear schedule** button to remove scheduling and keep the block always visible.

## Shared Style Options

Every block type supports these visual settings:

- Color variant (preset color scheme)
- Custom background, text, and border colors
- Border radius and width
- Shadow
- Hover or entrance animation
- Padding

## Reordering Blocks

Drag any block by its grip handle to rearrange the order. Changes save automatically.

## Toggling Visibility

Click the eye icon to show or hide a block. Hidden blocks stay in your list but don't appear on the public page. This is handy for:

- Temporarily removing content without deleting it.
- Preparing blocks ahead of time and enabling them later.
- Seasonal or time-limited content.

## Deleting a Block

Click the trash icon to permanently delete a block.

## Phone Preview

The right side of the builder shows a live phone preview of your page. On smaller screens, tap the floating button to open the preview in a modal. Use the light/dark toggle to see how your page looks in both modes.
