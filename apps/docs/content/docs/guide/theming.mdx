# Theming

LinkDen has two independent theming systems: one for the **admin panel** and one for the **public page**. This separation ensures that customizing your public page appearance never affects the admin experience, and vice versa.

## Admin Theme vs. Public Page Theme

### Admin Panel Theme

The admin panel uses `next-themes` to manage its Light/Dark/System toggle. This is a standard Next.js theme that:

- Persists across sessions via `localStorage`.
- Supports "System" mode that follows your OS preference.
- Uses Tailwind CSS dark mode classes (`dark:` variants).
- Is configured in the **Admin Theme** card on the Appearance page.

The admin theme has no connection to the public page theme presets. Selecting "Neon Cyber" for your public page does not turn your admin panel purple.

### Public Page Theme

The public page theme is controlled by:

1. A **theme preset** (one of 7 built-in presets).
2. **Custom color overrides** (primary, secondary, accent, background).
3. A **default color mode** (light, dark, or system).
4. Optional **custom CSS**.

These settings are stored in the database and applied to the public page via CSS custom properties.

## Theme Presets

Each preset defines a complete set of CSS variables for both light and dark modes. The presets are defined in `@linkden/ui/themes` and include:

| Preset | Primary | Style Notes |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Default** | `#0FACED` (Cyan) | Clean, modern |
| **Corporate Classic** | `#1E3A5F` (Navy) | Professional, subtle |
| **Corporate Modern** | `#0D9488` (Teal) | Contemporary |
| **Hacker Terminal** | `#16A34A` (Green) | Monospace-inspired, square corners |
| **Neon Cyber** | `#7C3AED` (Purple) | Vibrant, large border radius |
| **Furry Pastel** | `#EC4899` (Pink) | Warm, fully rounded |
| **Furry Bold** | `#EA580C` (Orange) | High energy |

When you select a preset, the color pickers automatically update to reflect the preset's light-mode palette. You can then override individual colors.

## Custom Color Overrides

Four colors can be overridden independently:

| Color | CSS Variable | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Primary | `--ld-primary` | Main accent, buttons, links |
| Secondary | `--ld-secondary` | Supporting elements |
| Accent | `--ld-accent` | Highlights, emphasis |
| Background | `--ld-background` | Page background |

Custom overrides are stored as **light-mode values**. They apply only when the public page is in light mode. In dark mode, the full preset-defined dark palette is used instead. This prevents color contrast issues that would arise from applying light-mode colors on a dark background.

---

## Color Mode

The public page supports three color modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Light** | Always uses the light variant |
| **Dark** | Always uses the dark variant |
| **System** | Matches the visitor's OS preference (`prefers-color-scheme`) |

### System Mode Detection

When "System" is selected:

- The **preview** in the admin panel detects your current OS preference using `window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")` and updates in real-time if you change your OS setting.
- The **public page** uses the visitor's browser-reported preference.
- Visitors can still manually toggle between light and dark with the on-page theme button.

### Mode Priority

The initial mode on the public page is resolved in this order:

1. Visitor's saved preference (from `localStorage`).
2. The default color mode set by the admin.
3. The visitor's OS preference (if mode is "system").

## CSS Variables Reference

Theme presets define the following CSS custom properties. All are available for use in custom CSS.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--ld-primary` | Primary accent color |
| `--ld-secondary` | Secondary color |
| `--ld-accent` | Accent/highlight color |
| `--ld-action` | Action/button color |
| `--ld-background` | Page background |
| `--ld-foreground` | Main text color |
| `--ld-card` | Card background |
| `--ld-card-foreground` | Card text color |
| `--ld-border` | Border color |
| `--ld-muted` | Muted background |
| `--ld-muted-foreground` | Muted text color |
| `--ld-radius` | Border radius |

Each preset defines values for all of these in both `.light` and `.dark` variants. The resolved values are computed at render time based on the active color mode.

---

## Banner Theming

Banner presets are **theme-aware**. The `getBannerPresetsForTheme()` function generates gradient presets using the current theme's resolved primary, accent, and background colors. This means:

- Changing your theme preset changes the banner gradient colors.
- Overriding custom colors also updates the banner presets.
- Custom image banners are not affected by theme changes.

## How Theme Data Flows

1. Admin selects a preset and/or custom colors on the Appearance page.
2. Settings are saved to the database as key-value pairs (e.g., `theme_preset: "neon-cyber"`, `custom_primary: "#7C3AED"`).
3. The `public.getPage` endpoint returns the theme settings to the public page.
4. The public page resolves the full CSS variable set from the preset, applies custom overrides for light mode, and injects the variables as inline styles.
5. The visitor's color mode preference determines which variant (light/dark) of the CSS variables is active.
